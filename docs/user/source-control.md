# Source Control Integrations

T3 Code connects to your Git hosting provider so you can create pull requests, review code, and manage repositories without leaving the app.

## Supported Providers

T3 Code works with the platforms your team already uses:

- **GitHub** – Pull requests, repository creation, and clone integration
- **GitLab** – Merge requests, repository publishing, and hosted clones
- **Bitbucket** – Pull request workflows (via API token authentication)
- **Azure DevOps** – Pull request support for Microsoft-hosted repositories

## What You Can Do

### Start Projects from Anywhere

**Clone repositories directly**

- Open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) → **Add Project**
- Choose **GitHub repository**, **GitLab repository**, **Bitbucket repository**, **Azure DevOps repository**, or paste any **Git URL**
- Enter the repository path (`owner/repo`, `group/project`, `workspace/repository`, or `project/repository`) or a full Git URL, pick a destination, and start coding

**Publish local projects to the cloud**

- Have a local Git repository without a remote?
- Use the **Publish Repository** action to create a new hosted repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps), add it as your origin remote, and push, in one flow
- If the local repository has no commits yet, publishing creates the remote and wires it up but does not push. Make a commit, then push normally.

### Manage Code Reviews Without Context Switching

**Create pull requests while you work**

- Push a branch and create a pull request from the Git actions controls in the toolbar
- T3 Code can suggest titles and descriptions based on your commits
- Supports GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests, Bitbucket Pull Requests, and Azure DevOps Pull Requests

**Stay on top of open reviews**

- See if your current branch already has an open PR/MR
- Open several reviews from the **Pull requests** page as tabs in the right panel
- While working in a thread, open linked reviews in the same compact right-panel tabs without
  leaving the conversation
- Open the review directly in your browser with one click
- If T3 Code cannot load a GitHub pull request, including when GitHub rate limits requests, use
  **Open on GitHub** in the error view
- Command-click (Control-click on Windows and Linux) a pull request number in the sidebar to open it in your browser instead of in T3 Code
- Check out a teammate's branch to review code locally

**Fix what you wrote, in place**

- Rewrite a pull request's title and description from the review itself, in Markdown, with a
  preview before you save
- Rewrite your own comments the same way, wherever they are shown
- Works on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Azure DevOps takes a new title and description; its
  comments stay read-only here, as they already were

### Know Your Setup at a Glance

The **Source Control settings** page shows you exactly what's connected:

- ✅ Which providers are authenticated and ready
- ⚠️ What's missing and how to fix it
- 👤 Which account is signed in (when available)

Run a quick **Rescan** after setting up a new machine or changing credentials.

## Getting Started

### For GitHub (Recommended for most users)

1. Install the GitHub CLI (version 2.81.0 or newer) on the machine running T3 Code:
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```
2. Sign in:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
3. Open **Settings → Source Control** in T3 Code and verify GitHub shows as authenticated

You can now clone, publish, and create pull requests.

### For GitLab

1. Install the GitLab CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install glab
   ```
2. Authenticate:
   ```bash
   glab auth login
   ```
3. Check **Settings → Source Control** to confirm the connection

### For Bitbucket

Bitbucket uses tokens instead of a CLI tool. Two options, both set as environment variables on the
machine running T3 Code.

Recommended, a Bitbucket access token:

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-access-token"
```

Or an Atlassian account email plus API token, with read/write access to pull requests and
repositories, plus read access to your user account (`read:user:bitbucket`, used to verify the
connection):

```bash
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_EMAIL="you@example.com"
export T3CODE_BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN="your-token"
```

If both are set, the access token wins. Restart T3 Code and verify the connection in **Source
Control settings**.

### For Azure DevOps

1. Install Azure CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install azure-cli
   ```
2. Add the DevOps extension:
   ```bash
   az extension add --name azure-devops
   ```
3. Sign in:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

### Worktree lifecycle scripts

Project scripts can run automatically around git worktrees and pull requests (configure them in the project scripts menu, or check them into `t3.json`):

- **Run on worktree creation** – starts after a new worktree thread is created (setup / install).
- **Run before worktree removal** – runs **before** `git worktree remove`. T3 waits for the script to exit; a non-zero exit **blocks** removal so process/data reaping can finish safely.
- **Run when the PR/MR merges** – independent of worktree removal. When T3’s source-control status sees the branch’s change request transition from open to merged, the script runs in that workspace/worktree (background; failures are logged).

Lifecycle scripts receive:

- `T3CODE_PROJECT_ROOT` – main project workspace
- `T3CODE_WORKTREE_PATH` – worktree path (or project root when not on a worktree)
- `T3CODE_LIFECYCLE` – `worktree-remove` or `pr-merged`
- Linked PR/MR (when known for that worktree/branch):
  - `T3CODE_PR` – primary handle (URL preferred)
  - `T3CODE_PR_NUMBER`, `T3CODE_PR_URL`, `T3CODE_PR_TITLE`
  - `T3CODE_PR_BASE_REF`, `T3CODE_PR_HEAD_REF`, `T3CODE_PR_STATE`

Use teardown / merge scripts to stop dev servers, drop temporary databases, or otherwise reap worktree-local resources.

## Requirements & Troubleshooting

**Git is required** – T3 Code uses Git for all local operations. Ensure `git` is installed on your server.

**Server-side setup** – Authentication happens on the machine running T3 Code (the server), not your local browser. If you're using a hosted or team instance, your administrator may have already configured providers.

**Common issues:**

- **Provider shows "Not authenticated"** – Run the login command for that provider (e.g., `gh auth login`) in a terminal on the server, then rescan in Settings
- **GitHub says it could not verify sign-in status** – T3 Code needs GitHub CLI 2.81.0 or newer to check sign-in status. Update `gh` (e.g., `brew upgrade gh`), then rescan
- **Bitbucket not connecting** – Double-check your environment variables are set in the correct shell profile and the server was restarted
- **Can't push to a remote** – Verify your Git remote URL matches the provider you've authenticated with (SSH vs HTTPS remotes may need different credentials)

**Need more help?** Check your provider's CLI documentation:

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [GitLab CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)
- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
